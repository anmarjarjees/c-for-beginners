# C Language for Beginners
Learning C Programming Language For Beginners

For this tutorial I used Visual Studio Code by adding/installing the following official extensions from Microsoft and installing the C++ compiler:

- Installing C++ Complier
-- For Mac/Linux C++ complier is already installed
-- For Windows:
--- You can download and install MinGW-w64. Notice that you need to know the location of this folder and mainly its sub-folder "bin"
--- Add the location of folder "bin" to windows system path => type "path" in the search box to open "Edit the system environment variables" window
--- Click "Advanced" Tab => Then Click "Environment Variables"
--- Select "Path" from the list then click "Edit" => Then Click "New" and paste the path of the "bin" folder to be added
--- Click Ok Then Ok again...
--- For testing/checking, open CMD window from any folder and type: g++ --version

- C/C++ Extension Pack (VS code)
- C/C++ IntelliSence debugging and code browsing (VS code)
